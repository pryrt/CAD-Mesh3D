Revision history for Perl distribution Win32-Mechanize-NotepadPlusPlus

v0.004 2021-Nov-21
    - My patched CAD::Format::STL was still being indexed, despite notice
      being auto-installed.  Added no_index and did the multi-line package
      command to try to avoid being indexed (#7)

v0.003 2020-Oct-25
    - Don't auto-patch CAD::Format::STL, so move the binmode check back to xt,
      get rid of the patching script, and provide a link to the patched file
      from the POD. (#7)
    - t\STL-outputStl.t: get rid of English dependency for system-based error
      messages (#6)
    - automatically propagate version number to all modules, and make copyright
      notice consistent throughout

v0.002 2020-Oct-24
    - Initial public release

v0.001
    - Initial pre-release development
